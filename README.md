Please create the necessary files for your multi-page Shiny app in this GitHub repository. Consult the Canvas assignment for more details. Be sure to publish your app on Shinyapps.io.

When you are finished, please add the text from your introductory and concluding pages below. You might want to use this GitHub repository as part of your digital portfolio, so you want this README.md to offer a brief description of the project and key takeaways.

Feel free to delete these instructions for your final README.md file and to make your GitHub repository public if you would like others to be able to see it. 

# Introduction

We first looked at some datasets that involved fruits and vegetable prices, however, that dataset has been taken down and we can no longer access it. We opted for a different dataset, where national crimes and types of crimes were collected.
We also took on the minimum wage dataset, and narrowed the dataset to a single year of 1973, to analyze if states' minimum wage had any correlation to crime rates in said state. 
Our research is to prove that the correlation between minimum wage and crimes are almost non-existent.
